Q:
    Explain why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList object whose current size is less than its capacity
    is a relatively fast operation and why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList object whose current size
    is at its capacity is a relatively slow operation.

ANS:
    When an ArrayList is initialized it is given a capacity and holds that much space. Adding objects up to the
    capacity does not require allocating more memory. Once you add items beyond its capacity additional processing power
    is needed to allocate the extra space in memory.
