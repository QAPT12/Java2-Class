Create a program which picks a number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number.  If the number is incorrect, the program should either indicate if the guess is too high or too low.
The program will store information about the guesses the user makes in a file named gamelog.txt
Each time a guess is made the program will record the user's guess on a new line.
When the correct guess is made, the program should exit.
