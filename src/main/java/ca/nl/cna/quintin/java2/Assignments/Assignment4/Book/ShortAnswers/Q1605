Briefly answer the following questions:

What is the primary difference between a Set and a Map?

    Sets are like a list, unordered and cannot contain duplicates.
    Maps store the data in key-value pairs allowing it to be easily indexed and can contain duplicate values.

What happens when you add a primitive type (e.g., double) value to a collection?

    When you try to add a primitive value to a collection Java will implicitly switch it to it's wrapper class.
    in other words if you try to add an int Java will automatically convert it to the wrapper class Integer.

Can you print all the elements in a collection without using an Iterator? If yes, how?

    Yes you can manually access the index of each item int the collection and print them out this way.
    i.e. System.out.println(list[0]);
         System.out.println(list[1]);
         System.out.println(list[2]);
